#Introducion

The scientific question motivating my work is "is there a seasonal trend for U.S.citizens to travel to Canada by air?" Canada is one of the closest country across the border of the United States. Many U.S. citizen consider Canada a great spot to travel during holiday. In the West Coast, we neighbor near Vancouver and Victoria, while the east coast has Toronto, Montreal and Quebec. 

#Dataset
